Notes: Javascript Data Structures
=================================

A data structure is a way of organizing data so that it can be used efficiently.

Abstract Data type (ADT): 
	
	Abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface which provides 

	only the interface to which a data structure must adhere on 
	
	
Ex: 

	Abstraction(ADT)							Implementation(DS)

	List													Dynamic Array
																Linked List

Big O:
-------
Contant: 			O(1)
Logarithmic: 	O(log(N))
Linear: 			O(N)
Linear-Log: 	O(Nlog(N))
Quadric: 			O(N^2)
Cubic: 				O(N^3)
Exponential: 	O(b^m), b > 1
Factorial:	 	O(n!)


Example:
********

low  := 0
high := n-1

While low <= high Do
	mid := (low + high)/2
	
	If arr[mid] == value: return mid 
	Else If array[mid] < value: low = mid + 1
 	Else If array[mid] > value: high = mid - 1

return -1 // Value not found

Complexity: O(logN)


Arrays:
--------

Access: 		O(1)				
Search: 		O(N)				
Insertion: 	O(N)				
Appending: 	O(1)				
Deletion: 	O(N)				
				
Note: 

	With JS I don't have to worry about generating a dynamic array. But I'll have

	to do it for C++. I think learning Templates and interfaces would be very beneficial 

	when creating Abstract data types.
