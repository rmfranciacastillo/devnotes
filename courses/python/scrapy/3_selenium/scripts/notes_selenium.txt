Notes: Selenium
=================

Selenium is perfect for using with JS generated content. It can imitate watching

as a user in a headless browser and allows you to interact with the site. 

For example, waiting for an Angular site to load by waiting for it to load. 

Or pressing a load more button for infinite loading.

Install: 

  ```
  pip install selenium
  ```

Note: Try to install this in virtual environment

Webdriver: 
----------

Use webdriver manager to download the webdrivers. Instead of configurating them

on your machine: 

  ```pip install webdriver-manager```


  // Same thing 
  from selenium import webdriver
  from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager

  driver = webdriver.Chrome(ChromeDriverManager().install())


API
---
driver.get(website)             # Get the website




Test:
-----
assert "stuff" in <driver-location>  # tests if something is present

  ex: assert "Python" in driver.title

To setup a test you need to import unit test library:

  ```
  import unittest
  ```

  // More details in the docs


Selecting Tags:
---------------

example:

  <input type="text" name="passwd" id="passwd-id" />

  element = driver.find_element_by_id("passwd-id")
  element = driver.find_element_by_name("passwd")
  element = driver.find_element_by_xpath("//input[@id='passwd-id']")
  element = driver.find_element_by_css_selector("input#passwd-id")

  Note: if not found, NoSuchElementException will be thrown
