Kali linux VM: // Need to relearn Docker for this one -_- 

Tools:
------
webhttrack  -> Downloads website assets. All of them. I guess you can lock it
                if you have multiple requests from a single IP. (It's f*cking slow 
                and hardly worth it)

theharvester -> The objective of this program is to gather emails, subdomains, 
                hosts, employee names, open ports and banners from different 
                public sources like search engines, PGP key servers and SHODAN 
                computer database. (Pretty cool search)
