STRATEGY: Web Apps
===================

After making a bunch of apps I always find new ways to contruct an app but always

forget why I do it in the order I build them. This is a simple reminder of what

strategies I use when building apps/websites. 


Prerequisites:

Client framework (I hate templates)
