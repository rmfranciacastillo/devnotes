Notes: C++
============

2's complement:
---------------

Adding numbers uses 2's complement it's a great way to add numbers without 

overflowing. 

for example: 

1 - 3 = -2 

// in 2's complement(1-> Invert all, 2-> Add one) 00000011 -> 11111100 -> 11111101 
---------

00000001
11111101
---------
11111110  // 2's complement of -2
Note: With 2's complement you can throw away the sign bit and won't have two zeroes. 

  (10000000 and 00000000) <- This would be a nightmare

Enum:
------

Datatypes with a limited set of data

  enum class Day {Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday};
  Day today {Day::Tuesday};


Arrays:
--------

You can use the old declaration 

  int x[10];

  or 

  int[10] x {}; // Fills an empty array

Can also include an array library

  #include <array>
  
  std::array<datatype, Number> stuff {};
 
  stuff.fill(3.1416);                   // Fills array with PI values.
